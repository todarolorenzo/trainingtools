# trainingtools
I want to collected every kind of training and educational tools. Preferably blended...
This my first experience on github. Why I'm here? I'm working on a project based on sharing skills. I want to discover if github could be the right tool to build a platform designed to share own skills. 

I have not coding skills, so I need to understand if github can help me to build a platform. To be clear: I'm looking for something like wordpress, but to build a platform.
